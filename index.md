This site is a personal knowledge base. It contains basic reference material that I use on a day-to-day basis. Some pages are very short, containing only links to external resources. Other pages are in depth articles explaining solutions to problems I have encountered (and will otherwise forget if I don't document them).

Hopefully you will find some value here.
