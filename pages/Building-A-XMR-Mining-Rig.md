From Reddit's [Least-Journalist-511](https://www.reddit.com/user/Least-Journalist-511/):

If you only have a limited about of power get a bunch of used Ryzen 3700x/3800x/3900x CPUs and compatible systems to put them in. If you put the legwork in you can probably get 5 of these machines for your budget. They will pull in 8-12KH each, so you'll probably see more or less the same income as using the servers I mentioned above. But it will only use 500-1000w instead of 3000+ watts for the servers.
