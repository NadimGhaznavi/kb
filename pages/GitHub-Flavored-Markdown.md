# Introduction and Scope

This page provides links and useful tips on writing *GitHub Flavored Markdown* (GFM). GFM is a Wiki like 
markdown language that allows you to create structured HTML pages without writing HTML. Pages written in GFM
can be uploaded to GitHub where they are automatically converted into HTML. This allows you to quickly create
high quality HTML pages without writing any HTML code.

# Linking to Headers within a Markdown Page

To create a link within a markdown page use the following syntax.

Example markdown header:
```
# This is an Example Header
```
Markdown code to link to this header within the same page:
```
[Link to Example Header](#this-is-an-example-header)
```
As shown in the example above the link is just the header text, but all lowercase and with spaces replaced by the hyphen or dash character.
