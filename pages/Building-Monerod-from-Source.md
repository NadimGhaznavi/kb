title: "Building Monerod from Source"
---

# Introduction

This page documents the process of downloading, configuring and installing the core Monero software. The specific directories referenced here are consistent with the [system architecture](#system-architecture) outlined below.

This is the authoritative Monero core software which includes the following:

```
monero-blockchain-ancestry	    monero-blockchain-prune			monero-gen-ssl-cert
monero-blockchain-depth		      monero-blockchain-prune-known-spent-data	monero-gen-trusted-multisig     monero-blockchain-export	  monero-blockchain-stats			monero-wallet-cli               monero-blockchain-import	  monero-blockchain-usage			monero-wallet-gui               monero-blockchain-mark-spent-outputs  
monerod
```

As well as the following static libraries:
```
libwallet.a  libwallet_api.a
```

# Install Pre-Requisites

Use the command below to install the pre-requisites required to build the software.

```
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake miniupnpc libunbound-dev graphviz doxygen libunwind8-dev pkg-config libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libsodium-dev libhidapi-dev libnorm-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libpgm-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libgcrypt20-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-locale-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-serialization-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev
```

While this document is focused on the Monero Daemon, the software we're installing includes the official Monero wallet GUI. To ensure a successful compile, you'll also need to install supporting Qt libraries for displaying the GUI:

```
sudo apt install qtbase5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qml-module-qtqml-models2 qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-dialogs qml-module-qtquick-xmllistmodel qml-module-qt-labs-settings qml-module-qt-labs-platform qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel qttools5-dev-tools qml-module-qtquick-templates2 libqt5svg5-dev
```

# Deployment Architecture

I put source code in `/opt/src` and installed software in `/opt/prod`. For example:

Directory                    | Description
-----------------------------|-------------------
`/opt/src/monerod-0.18.4.0`  | Source code
`/opt/prod/monerod-0.18.4.0` | Installed code
`/opt/prod/p2pool`           | Symlink to installed code directory

Within the installed software directories I use the following convention:

Directory   | Description
------------|-------------------
`bin`       | Directory to house executibles 
`logs`      | Directory to house logs
`conf`      | Directory to house configuration files
`run`       | Directory to contain temporary runtime files

# Download the Source Code

I am installing version **0.18.4.0** of the software. The directory name I use reflects that specific version. You may need to change this if you are working with a newer version.

```
cd /opt/src
sudo git clone --depth=1 --recursive https://github.com/monero-project/monero-gui
sudo mv monero-gui monerod-0.18.4.0
```

---

# Configure and Build

Assuming you are using the directory names that were used in the section above:

```
cd /opt/src/monerod-0.18.4.0
sudo make release -j4
```

The `-j4` flag tells `make` to use 4 CPU cores when doing the build. You may want to change this to a different number (or leave it out entirely to use only 1 core) depending on how many CPU cores you have available. I get some warnings when compiling, I'm assuming these are safe to ignore. 

---

# Install the Software

As mentioned in the [production code management section](#production-code-management) above, I install custom software in `/opt/prod`

Create a directory to house the software, note that the instuctions include the version number of the software. You may need to change this if you are compiling a later version.

# Actually Install the Software

Assuming you are using the same paths as outlined in this document:

```
sudo cp -a /opt/src/monerod-0.18.4.0/build/release/bin /opt/prod/monerod
sudo cp -a /opt/src/monerod-0.18.4.0/build/release/lib /opt/prod/monerod
```

# Configuring the Monero Daemon as a Service
