# Upgrading a Dependency

This example shows how to upgrade from Textual 4.0.0 to 6.0.0.

Edit the `pyproject.toml` file and change the `textual = "^4.0.0"` to `textual = "^6.0.0"`.

Then run `poetry update textual`

Verify with a `poetry show textual`

# Adding a New Module

Add the module to your `pyproject.toml` file: E.g.

```
textual-plotext = "^1.0.1"
```

Then run `poetry lock ; poetry install`.
