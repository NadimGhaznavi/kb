# Introduction and Scope

This page provides information about generators in the Python programming language. Generators simulate events outside of the system. They provide a gateway for information to flow into the system. Generators can also be pipelined and pipelines of gnerators can be split into threads, processces or across the network.

Rather than polling a live system, a generator connects itself to the data outputs of the live system and makes that information available to the application, in a way that is similar to a FIFO (First In, First Out) queue.

Cool stuff!!
